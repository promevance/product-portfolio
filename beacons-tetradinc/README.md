# Beacons Agency — Growth Marketing Portfolio  
### SimlessPay & TetradPay

## About Beacons Agency

Beacons is a growth and marketing agency working with fintech and technology companies across Africa and Europe.

At Beacons, I worked closely with internal teams and client stakeholders to **own and execute growth initiatives**, operating at the intersection of product marketing, lifecycle strategy, and data-informed decision-making.

## Products Managed

### SimlessPay
- B2C remittance platform  
- Primary corridor: UK → Nigeria  
- Emotion-driven use case (family support, everyday remittances)  
- Cost-sensitive, trust-led audience  

### TetradPay
- B2C cross-border payments platform  
- Broader European market  
- More professional, reliability-focused positioning  
- Similar infrastructure, distinct messaging and audience emphasis  

Both products required **high trust**, **clear education**, and **repeat usage**, rather than one-off transactions.

## My Role

**Growth Marketing & Lifecycle Management**

I was responsible for:

- Lifecycle marketing strategy and execution  
- CRM structure and evaluation  
- Product messaging and positioning  
- User activation and retention  
- Growth initiatives with minimal paid spend  

This role required balancing **data analysis, customer psychology, and product understanding**, rather than focusing purely on acquisition.

---

## Growth Philosophy Applied

Remittance products are not used daily by most users. Retention depends more on:

- Trust and reassurance  
- Emotional connection  
- Habit formation  
- Ease and clarity of use  

My approach focused on **owning the full customer lifecycle**, not just driving installs.

---

## Growth Strategy Overview

### 1. Behaviour Tracking & Insight

We used **Mixpanel** and **AppRadar** to understand:

- Feature usage patterns  
- Drop-off and churn points  
- Transaction frequency and timing  
- User value over time  

These insights informed lifecycle design, messaging, and prioritisation.

---

### 2. Lifecycle & CRM Execution

Based on observed behaviour:

- Onboarding flows were refined  
- Product education was introduced through:  
  - In-app messaging  
  - Email communication  
  - Short, practical content  
- Messaging was timed to real user actions, not assumptions  

We primarily used **Customer.io** (and eventually added **Systeme.io**), alongside other in-app messaging and email automation tools, to manage lifecycle communication at scale.

---

### 3. Messaging & Positioning

Messaging was intentionally **emotional but practical**, particularly for SimlessPay.

Recurring themes included:

- “Sending love home”  
- Encouraging consistent, habitual usage  
- Reinforcing saving and planning as part of remittance behaviour  

For TetradPay, messaging leaned more toward **clarity, reliability, and professionalism**, reflecting its audience.

---

### 4. Community & Referral-Led Growth

Growth relied heavily on:

- Referral incentives  
- In-app nudges  
- Consistent messaging  
- Trust-based advocacy  

During key growth phases, **paid advertising was minimal or absent**, making lifecycle and referrals critical drivers.
